### Matt

[Matt](https://twitter.com/qtychr) Adams, born March 27th 2015,  grew up on a rual planet of Earth. He went to Della Musica Highschool and has a fasinating for flying. After graduating he joined the UN Spacy as a ifghter piloet. He showed his extraordinary skill again-and-again as he fought renegade Zentradi in his VF-11 Thunderbolt variable fighter leading to an astronomical kill count.  However his skill came with a penchant for showmanship, dare devilry, and an independent smart-mouth personality. Vices that did not endear him to his superiors, no matter how skilled he was. An incident during an asteroid skirmish finally convinced his superiors to get rid of him by assigning him to Project Super Nova as a test pilot, ironically something Isamu had desired for a long time.
