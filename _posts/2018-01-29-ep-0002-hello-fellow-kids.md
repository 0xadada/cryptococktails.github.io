## Poloniex and AntPool

Updates from the previous episode
re: [Antpool tweets at Poloniex for "help!"](https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/953720602140999680). It 


Seems [Poloniex had problems with account balances the same
day](https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/953720602140999680) saying quote

> "Some balances are off and will be corrected. Forced liquidations are turned off temporarily."

Haven't heard anything more since then.

## South Koean taxes bitcoin

Korea increases taxes on coins, create strict rules for moving money to virtual exchanges.

## The Tether Report

[The Tether Report](http://www.tetherreport.com/)
Tether is growing through minting coins in response to market conditions.
Tether minting coins moves the market for BTC price, 48.8% of BTCs price rise
after a 2-hour window following the deposit of 91 different tether grants to a known Bitfinex wallet.

## Merrill Lynch Bans Crypto Assets

[merrill lynch bans clients from investing in bitcoin
fund](https://www.coindesk.com/merrill-lynch-bans-clients-from-investing-in-bitcoin-fund/)

## Changelly Experiences

0xADADA used changelly to dump Bitcoin Gold. There are a few similar
services like shapeshift.io, but the gist is that instead of manually listing
your alt cryptos on an exchange, selling them for another currency, you just
specify the wallet address you want to recieve funds at, send them the
currencies you wish to get rid of, and they handle the exchange themselves. Its
a nice user experience, but it takes about 30 minutes or an hour for the trade
to occur, for bitcoin gold to bitcoin.
